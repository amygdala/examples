# 'Cookbook' examples

This directory contains how-tos for various common Kubeflow and Kubeflow Pipelines tasks. It is a work in progress, and the set of examples will grow larger in future.

The [notebooks](./notebooks) directory currently contains several notebook-based examples of how to deploy a [Kubeflow Pipeline](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/) from outside the Kubeflow cluster.

The [automl](./automl) directory gives a simple example of how you can make calls to the [AutoML Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/automl/) to build a pipeline that creates an AutoML *dataset* and then trains a model on that dataset.
